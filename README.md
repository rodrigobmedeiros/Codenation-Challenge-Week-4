# Probability functions

In this challenge we will practice on hypothesis testing, one of the central concepts
statistical inference and all research that uses statistics as a support.

## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to explore some of the available hypothesis testing functions
in packages like SciPy, learning to interpret their results, being critical about
its uses and understand a little about its workings.

For this, we'll use the _data set_ [2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro](https://www.kaggle.com/rio2016/olympic-games/)
which consists of 11 variables regarding 11538 athletes who participated in the
2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

## Topics


In this challenge we will explore:

* Probability
* Statistics
* Hypothesis testing
* A / B tests

## Requirements

You will need Python 3 and pip. It is highly recommended to use virtual environments
with virtualenv and the `requirements.txt` file to install the dependency packages
challenge:

```bash
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv -p python3
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows

```bash
> pip3 install virtualenv
> virtualenv ..\venv -p python3
> ..\venv\Scripts\activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When finished, you can disable the virtualenv virtual environment with:

```bash
$ deactivate
```
